                        <p>Hello there! How are you? I'm fine. Thank you. Did you have your dinner tonight? I must say that I've already had my meal few minutes ago. Today I ate rice with tiny fish curry and a vegetable we call it lalshak. I don't know the english word for lalshak. So, do not blame me for this.</p>
